The goal of this project is to try and implement the Needleman-Wunsch (global) and Smith-Waterman (local) for global and local alignment.

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is mainly used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotoide sequences. It is based on dynamic programming.

The Smith-Waterman algorithm is also based on dynamic programming and the main difference between these two algorithms is the fact that the former is used for global sequence alignment and the latter for local sequence alignment.
